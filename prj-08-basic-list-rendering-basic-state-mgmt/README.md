# Goal
* List of projects
  * You can
    * add elements
    * drag & drop elements
  * :warning: It's just the eighth chapter of the section, not all is included

# Note
* Steps to create / build the project
    * `npm init`
        * Creates the package.json
    * `npm install --save-dev lite-server`
        * Install and add to the package.json to the dev section
    * Add script `start` launching the lite-server
    * `tsc --init`
      * Create a 'tsconfig.json'
      * From now, the project is a typescript project
    * Create 'dist' folder
      * folder which stores the output files
* [lite-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lite-server)
    * Lightweight development only node server that serves a web app
    * Serves the index.html on a server
    * Refresh the pages each time some change in the code is done
        * But if you change .ts, manually you need to compile again to generate the proper .js
* Architecture 
  * Monolithic
    * It could be divided in modules, but it will be done, when we see 'modules' section

# How to run?
* `npm install`
    * Install all the dependencies
* `tsc--watch` / `tsc -w`
    * Compile all the .ts files to .js
    * Watch changes in .ts files
* `npm start`
    * Run the start script
    * Start up the lite server
        * 'localhost:3000'
            * Output of the server
        * 'localhost:3001'
            * UI of the lite-server
    * Check the chrome debugger console

# How to debug using VSC?
